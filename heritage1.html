    <p>Rajwada, also known as the Holkar Palace or Old Palace, is a historical palace in Indore that was constructed by the Holkars of the Maratha empire around 2 centuries ago. An example of the architecture of the time, the palace is a 7 story structure that is placed near the Holkar Chhatris. The structure has gained the attention of tourists due to its size and age.

        The construction of the palace was started by Malhar Rao Holkar, the founder of Holkar Dynasty, in the year 1747 A.D. This structure is placed in Khajuri Bazaar, near the center of the city. The palace has the Shiv Vilas Palace (New Palace) on the right and faces a garden with a statue of Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar, fountains, and an artificial waterfall.</p>
